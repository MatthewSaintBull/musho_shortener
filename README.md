### My Url Shortener

This project was made by *Matteo* **Sherl** *Santoro* as a study object, 
so if you see the code which is not very elegant, it's normal.


## PACKAGES

#### This project require some composer packages.

* Install **Composer** from [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
* Install **JWT package** from [here](https://packagist.org/packages/firebase/php-jwt)
* Install **Mongodb package** from [here](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-library)


#### What you get in this project :
* the api set for the backend of a url shortener
* the jwt class for a 2 factors authentication (i needed this for ionic 3 as frontend)
* the mongomanager class made by me for the mongodb manager


## How to start the project

You can use what you want as a server, but i tested it all on the local webserver installed directly from php7.
If you want to use it, then you need to move to the directory of the project and then launch the instruction
 ```
        php -S localhost:8888
 ```
